## Known Bugs or Issues
None. All functions (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `bad_add`, and `get_greeting`) have passing tests and full coverage. Memory leaks and intentional crashes used for testing were removed in the final submission.

## Experience
This project was a great hands-on exercise in C programming, testing, and debugging. I practiced writing header and source files, creating proper function prototypes, and implementing functions with attention to memory management. Using Unity for tests helped me catch mistakes early, and adding `bad_add` demonstrated how tests detect incorrect behavior. 

I learned to generate code coverage reports and interpret them to ensure 100% coverage, which was very satisfying. Running intentional crashes and leaks gave me insight into debugging tools like AddressSanitizer and how release vs. debug builds behave. 

Overall, this project strengthened my understanding of C development workflows, test-driven development, and proper memory handling.
